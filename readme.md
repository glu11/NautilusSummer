# Nautilus Software Technologies Internship
This is my portfolio for my SWE Internship at Nautilius Software Technologies.

This repo holds my chatbot Nemobot.js which runs through Facebook Messenger and allows for
students to choose the Math topic + video type they want to watch. Then app.js which runs on 
the external server uses web automation + my quality algorithm to recommend the best video.
